# Deep-GRAIL Algorithm: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Imitation Learning

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the code base for the Deep-GRAIL algorithm, with a specific application to solve the sum-rate maximization problem in rate-splitting multiuser systems. The code includes the implmentations of the learning algorithm, deep neural network models, system model for the rate-spliting multiuser systems, as well as a conventional optimization algorithm. If you use our code or data please cite [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12191).
