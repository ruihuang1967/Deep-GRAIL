# Deep-GRAIL Algorithm for Rate-Splitting Systems
Deep-GRAIL: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Imitation Learning

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the code base for the Deep-GRAIL algorithm, with a specific application to maximize the sum-rate in rate-splitting multiuser systems. The code includes the implmentations of the learning algorithm, deep neural network models, system model for the rate-spliting multiuser systems, as well as a conventional optimization algorithm.
